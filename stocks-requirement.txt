2. Weekly -  if this week close is higher than 2 weeks ago open price and 2 weeks open price is higher than 2 weeks close price also, one week open price is lower than 1 week close price. If the condition is met, then print "TF-long" else print "no -signal" in the outputfile.
3. Monthly-  if this month close is higher than 2 months ago open price and 2 months open price is higher than 2 months close price. The one month open price should be lower than 1 month close price. If the condition is met, then print "TF-long" else print "no -signal" in the outputfile.
4. Weekly-immediate  -  if this week close is higher than previous week open price and previous week open price is higher than previous weeks close price. If the condition is met, then print "TF-long" else print "no -signal" in the outputfile.
